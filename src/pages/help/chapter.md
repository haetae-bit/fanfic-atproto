# How do I import chapters?

This page serves as a guide for importing chapters into a work. Currently, only these types of chapters are allowed:

- Bluesky posts
- Leaflet.pub documents*

\* = This must already be published in a publication!

## How do I import a Bluesky post?

1. First, go on `bsky.app` and grab the URL of the post you want to import.

2. Go to [PDSls](https://pdsls.dev/) and enter the URL you just copied.

3. You'll be taken to a page that has a bar with three tabs: "Records", "Backlinks", and "Info". Select **"Info"**.

5. In the "Info" tab, you should find the **"AT URI"**. Copy and paste this into the import field.
